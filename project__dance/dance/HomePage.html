<tr><td>Dance is a physical and visual art form, which has an immediate and massive impact on the spectator. The various Indian forms act like 
a window to India's rich cultural reservoir. Dance is the form of art, wherein the body is used as a medium of communication. Indian 
dances have played an influential role in many other realms of art including poetry, sculpture, architecture, literature, music and theatre. 
The earliest archaeological evidence of Indian dance, which dates back to 6000 BC, depicts a beautiful statuette of a dancing girl. 
Bharata's Natya Shastra (which was written between the 2nd century B.C. and 2nd century A.D) is the earliest available thesis on 
dramaturgy. All forms of Indian classical dances owe allegiance to Natya Shastra, which is believed to be the 'fifth Veda' of the Indian 
culture. According to a popular belief, Brahma, the Creator of the World, combined literature from the Rig Veda, songs from the Sama 
Veda, abhinaya (expression) from the Yajur Veda and rasa (aesthetic experience) from the Atharva Veda, to form natya (what we today 
call dance). It explains the nuances of dance, giving stress on mudras (hand formations) and their meanings, the kind of emotions and
 their categorization.</td>
