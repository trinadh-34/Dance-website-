Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form of South India, said to 
be originated in Thanjavoor of Tamil Nadu.  It was known as "Daasiyattam" since performed by Devadasies 
in temples of Tamil Nadu long ago. The name 'Bharatanatyam' is derived from three basic concepts of Bhava, 
Raga and Thaala. The modern Bharatanatyam was systematically regularized by well known 'Thanjavoor Brothers', 
Ponnayya, Chinnayya, Sivanandam and Vativelu.The sequence of the dance performance is 'Alarippu', 'Jathiswaram', 'Sabdam',
  'Varnam', 'Padam' and 'Thillana'. After 'Thillana', with a 'Mangala Slokam' the dance program ends.
 Normally the performance lasts for two to two and half hours.
