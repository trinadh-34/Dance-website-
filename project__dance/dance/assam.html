<b><ul><li>Bihu Dance</b>
<br><br>
Bihu is the most popular folk dance of Assam. The people of Assam are very proud of it and rightly so. 
Except Bhangra no other folk dance in India can compete with the rythmic exuberance of Bihu. Bihu dances

hips represents youthful passion, reproductive urge and 'Joie-de-vivre'.
