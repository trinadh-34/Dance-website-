<ul><li><b>Garbha Dance<br></b>
A graceful, rather unique dance associated with the raas lila of Krishna and the gopis (female cowherds). This is danced by both men and 
women, moving in a circle holding and clicking painted sticks with attached bells. These are the famous dandiya sticks and have led to 
Garbha being referred to as dandiya raas. Formerly associated with the legend of Krishna, Garbha is now a regular feature during the 
Navratri puja (nine nights in honor and worship of the goddess Durga).

<li><b>Dandiya Dance</b><br>
Ideally, two circles formed by men and women move in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions with two sticks called dandiyas held in their hands. The song sung on the occasion is essentially an amorous one. Raas is a very energetic, colourful and playful dance providing opportunity for acting and exchanging messages through eye contact. It is no wonder that many romances bloom during Navaratri and hence the popularity of the dance among the younger generation.
