Garba  is an Indian form of dance that originated in the Gujarat region. It is more similar to 
Western folk dance than to the presentational style of Indian classical dances such as bharatanatyam and odissi. 
The name garba comes from the Sanskrit term Garbha ("womb") and Deep ("a small earthenware lamp"). Many 
traditional garbas are performed around a central lit lamp. The circular and spiral figures of Garba have similarities
 to other spiritual dances. Traditionally it is performed during the nine-day Hindu festival NavarATRI, RATRI = nights). 
Either the lamp (the Garba Deep) or an image of the Goddess Durga 
(also called Amba) is placed in the middle of concentric rings as an object of veneration.
