Bhangra   is a form of dance and music that originated in the Punjab region.
 Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi Sikh farmers to celebrate the 
coming of the harvest season. The specific moves of Bhangra reflect the manner in which villagers
 farmed their land. This dance art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when
 refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions
 they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The folk dance has been popularised in the western world by
 Punjabi Sikhs and is seen in the West as an expression of South Asian culture as a whole.Today, Bhangra dance
 survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, 
collegiate competitions and cultural shows.
